# Practical Machine Learning Project

The html version of the writeup may be viewed in your browser at http://jeffjetton.github.io/pml_project/pml_project.html

The writeup only displays the most necesssary R code for conciseness. Additional code was used to create the full writeup, but not echoed out to the final report. To few these additional details (including models that were considered but discarded), please inspect the "raw" version of the .Rmd file.

Thanks!
